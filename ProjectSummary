  Our project is a locally hosted twitter-like website. It allows the user to create an account, create posts, follow other users, 
as well as a few other functions. The websites information is stored in a database so it will rememer every user and every post that
has not been deleted. To use the website, all you have to do is download the files from our repo and run the "run" file, then you can
become a tweeter too.
